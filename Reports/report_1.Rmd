## Overview of the Approach 

Recent studies suggest that deep learning-based molecular modelling may improve the speed of in silico drug discovery. There are many types of deep-learning-based modelling approaches present, as they allow us to build molecules one atom at a time and connect them. However, each approaches has its own limitations. In this paper, we have been introduced to another graph-based approach that is called *MoLeR*.

Graph-based models that generate molecules sequentially employ perfect validity because they can enforce hard chemical constraints such as valence. Compared to SMILES-based methods, this approach is more efficient and easier to use. Graph-based generated molecules are required to fit certain valence constraints. One of the common constraints that are considered in graph-based drug discovery projects is to include a scaffold, which is a predefined subgraph.

One of the significant limitations of graph-based models is, that they require a rigid scaffold to be present in order to generate a molecule. However, this existed scaffold may not be always available in rigid form. To overcome this issue, this study proposed a new model *MoLeR*, which is a graph-based model that naturally supports scaffolds as initial seeds for the generation procedure. @Maziarz2021 *MoLeR* offers a fragment-by-fragment generation of molecules instead of atom-by-atom. Below, the overall framework of *MoLeR* is summarized:

a)  The *MoLeR* method employs common molecular fragments called motifs, which can be used to build molecules fragment-by-fragment. Most partial molecules that are constructed during generation are semantically sensible, meaning they don't contain half-built structures such as partial rings. Thus, the first step of the *MoLeR* method is to discover motifs from data.

b) The second step includes using the detected motifs to decompose an input molecule into motifs and single atoms.

c) The deterministic encoder takes features from the bottom layer and embeds them into the top layer, making the motif information available at the atom level.

d) The last step is the decoder step. Decoder steps are only dependent on the encoder output and the partial graph, so they have to choose one of the valid options. 

## Discussion

The *MoLeR* model uses an auto-encoder paradigm to train the model and, graphs to represent molecules. Atoms are represented by vertices, and the connections between them are based on the bonds between them. The *MoLeR* model has a deterministic encoder, which attempts to compress an input molecule into a latent code and, always, returns the maximum likelihood latent code z (which corresponds to the mean of the predicted Gaussian). The decoder then tries to reconstruct the original molecule using this code. This deterministic encoding approach seems to improve predictions.

In the decoding step, the reconstruction process itself is designed to be sequential in order to decompress a short encoding into a graph of any size. As a result, it can complete the graph by adding new atoms or bonds throughout each step. The decoder, in the model makes predictions based on a partial graph at each step.

In summary, the proposed model *MoLeR* generates molecules without relying on past predictions. Besides being able to complete partial or arbitrary scaffolding and, optimizing the scaffolding constraints using motifs, *MoLeR* also outperforms the existing graph-based modelling methods as they are limited by the requirements of scaffolding. 

This method brings attention to graph-link prediction. I was wondering if the autoencoders used in *MoLeR* are able to predict the motifs more accurately than the proposed method here @Besta2021. Or replacing motif prediction mechanisms of *MoLeR* with the offered link-prediction framework can increase accuracy or not. How reliable are these predictions, and why not relying on the prediction history improved performance? 

The authors stated even if a molecule does not violate valence constraints, it can still contain unstable or unsynthesisable substructures. And, they offered an optimization methodology.Is there any change present using *MoLeR* to over-smoot the scaffold constraints?  What are the limitations of smoothing constraints? How can we prevent generating molecules that contain unstable or unsynthesisable substructures? These are the questions that did not specifically point out by the authors or at least, I am not able to answer them completely. 

In addition, I would like to see how we can detect if *MoLeR* over-smoots the scaffold constraints. The paper needed to state a vocabulary that implies what makes a constraint a good to constrain, when or where should we use optimization, etc.
