abstract = {Virtual screening can accelerate drug discovery by identifying promising candidates for experimental evaluation. Machine learning is a powerful method for screening, as it can learn complex structure-property relationships from experimental data and make rapid predictions over virtual libraries. Molecules inherently exist as a three-dimensional ensemble and their biological action typically occurs through supramolecular recognition. However, most deep learning approaches to molecular property prediction use a 2D graph representation as input, and in some cases a single 3D conformation. Here we investigate how the 3D information of multiple conformers, traditionally known as 4D information in the cheminformatics community, can improve molecular property prediction in deep learning models. We introduce multiple deep learning models that expand upon key architectures such as ChemProp and Schnet, adding elements such as multiple-conformer inputs and conformer attention. We then benchmark the performance trade-offs of these models on 2D, 3D and 4D representations in the prediction of drug activity using a large training set of geometrically resolved molecules. The new architectures perform significantly better than 2D models, but their performance is often just as strong with a single conformer as with many. We also find that 4D deep learning models learn interpretable attention weights for each conformer.},

@article{Cramer1988,
abstract = {Comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) is a promising new approach to structure/activity correlation. Its characteristic features are (1) representation of ligand molecules by their steric and electrostatic fields, sampled at the intersections of a three-dimensional lattice, (2) a new “field fit” technique, allowing optimal mutual alignment within a series, by minimizing the RMS field differences between molecules, (3) data analysis by partial least squares (PLS), using cross-validation to maximize the likelihood that the results have predictive validity, and (4) graphic representation of results, as contoured three-dimensional coefficient plots. CoMFA is exemplified by analyses of the affinities of 21 varied steroids to corticosteroid- and testosterone-binding globulins. Also described are the sensitivities of results to the nature of the field and the definition of the lattice and, for comparison, analyses of the same data using various combinations of other parameters. From these results, a set of ten steroid-binding affinity values unknown to us during the CoMFA analysis were well predicted. {\textcopyright} 1988, American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.},

@article{Goodford1985,
abstract = {The interaction of a probe group with a protein of known structure is computed at sample positions throughout and around the macromolecule, giving an array of energy values. The probes include water, the methyl group, amine nitrogen, carboxy oxygen, and hydroxyl. Contour surfaces at appropriate energy levels are calculated for each probe and displayed by computer graphics together with the protein structure. Contours at negative energy levels delineate regions of attraction between probe and protein and are found at known ligand binding clefts in particular. The contours also enable other regions of attraction to be identified and facilitate the interpretation of protein-ligand energetics. They may, therefore, be of value for drug design. {\textcopyright} 1985, American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.},
